            Any time the terms "fair" or "value" come up, things get tricky because there is no single definition for
            either that everyone could ever agree on. In terms of an incentive structure that would best benefit the
            network and adoption of the currency, we believe that faucet distribution has its limitations. One of the
            major barriers preventing further adoption of cryptocurrencies is that there isn't always a clear economic
            incentive to solve the problems that really need solving. For example, if a crypto that is mined ever needs
            a new payment integration or mobile app, who would work on that? What would their incentive be? The idea
            that because there might be many people that own that currency, there are also going to be a lot of people
            with the incentive to work on such tasks is not realistic. That's why, for example, numerous popular cryptos
            have few integrations and bad looking UIs. With the incentive model of rewarding contributors an amount of
            coins based on the value they have given to the network and/or the community, it not only allows us to
            tackle these issues, but brings a more diverse range of contributors and community members to thenewboston

            <p>
              Our tech docs outline what would happen if the PV was proven to be malicious. The two main situations that
              were covered are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the PV intentionally tries to fork the network by sending two or more different versions or the
                same block (valid signatures on different blocks with the same block number).
              </li>
              <li>
                When the PV intentionally or unintentionally generates an invalid block. Intentional in the case they
                were attempting to cheat, and unintentional if there was an error in their calculation (bug, database
                issue, and so on).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In either of these cases, when the Confirmation Validators (CVs) discover this issue, they will broadcast
              the evidence out to all other CVs and they will all switch over to the next validator in line as PV, based
              on the schedule. The process is actually a bit more technical than that for anyone who hasn’t read through
              the docs, but that’s the gist of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also another situation regarding a non-responsive PV. This is when the PV is intentionally or
              unintentionally ignoring requests from one or more nodes. IHere, the CVs would also need to communicate
              with one another and switch over to a new PV. What makes this situation more challenging is that there is
              no signed evidence, like duplicate signatures or an incorrect calculation, so the answer to “is the PV
              responsive?” becomes a bit more subjective.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can break the problem down by looking at the network from the perspective of a single CV. If we are a
              CV and someone is using us as their active node (soon to be called a “connection” node) and we forward
              their request to the PV, if we receive an error from the PV or a sign that the server is offline, we can
              request a change in PV right away. However, the tricky part comes when we don’t get an error from the PV,
              indicating that they received the request with no issues, but then we just don’t see those changes on the
              blockchain. This shows one of two things.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The PV has a large amount of blocks in their queue and is currently bottlenecked/taking time to work
                through them all. In this case, those changes will appear on the blockchain eventually.
              </li>
              <li>
                The PV decided to maliciously ignore our request, most likely because it wasn’t beneficial to them
                (perhaps the request was for boosting a competing node).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              From our (the CV’s) perspective, it is impossible to know the true reason for this. Because of that, the
              architecture was designed so the CV doesn’t need to figure out the reason. Whether the PV is intentionally
              or unintentionally ignoring the request is irrelevant. The CV can label the PV as having network issues
              and indicate to all others that they would prefer a switch in PV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we didn’t write this logic yet (which will most likely be post beta) the CV can also begin to
              route its blocks through another CV rather than directly to the PV. This will either force the PV to
              validate the blocks or prove to that other CV that the PV is indeed experiencing network issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the question that remains in all of this is how long exactly the CV must wait before requesting a
              change in PV. Because there is no one right answer to that, we allow this to be configurable by the node
              maintainer. Users will see what value the node maintainer sets for this when they choose which nodes to
              boost. The node maintainer will set a value that they feel is acceptable when factoring in network
              latency, network load, historical average transaction times, and so on. This value will probably change
              overtime. As the network grows and needs to handle more traffic, we will encounter many unforeseen
              bottlenecks which might require a higher value to be set. Then again, as more developers fix these
              bottlenecks and optimize the network we will be able to lower this value to a point where all CVs will
              have very high performance requirements for the PV. That is the direction we are aiming for.

              The barriers preventing further adoption at the moment relate to the tasks that we are currently working
              on, including, yet not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Education. Community members need to understand clearly how the architecture works (so, we are working
                on updating the website, planning tutorials, and so on)
              </li>
              <li>
                Support from and collaboration with other crypto communities. Even though thenewboston has 2.5 million
                subscribers, a solid social media following, and so on (which all sound like a lot), what we are aiming
                for we can't accomplish alone. We will need to unite many other crypto and development communities and
                we have already seen a glimpse of this with community members of Nano and Banano. This will come much
                later, but it is very inspiring to see the collaboration and support between our communities even this
                early.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beta. The beta architecture will include a transparent voting system for the government and nodes. This
                is critical to decentralization.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment integrations. For website owners to integrate with the network, we need easy-to-use payment
                integrations and developer libraries (currently in development).
              </li>
              <li>
                Good and services. The value of any currency is what it can be exchanged for. Once we have payment
                integrations, then websites and, later, physical stores can begin selling their goods and services. That
                is going to be a major milestone for us.

              In reality there was never such a thought. It was more like "this is actually a great idea and would be a
              huge improvement to the traditional economy, however, for this thing to take off, someone should solve all
              these bottlenecks".
            </p>
            <p>
              It all started when Bucky read through the Bitcoin architecture, drew up how all the data was flowing
              through the network, and laid everything out, so he could see it on his coffee table in his living room.
              In terms of tech, the main inefficiencies were:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mining. Miners were solving this energy intensive problem which had nothing to do with the transaction
                validation itself, rather this was a "human" problem of distributed consensus
              </li>
              <li>
                Wasted work. As soon as one miner found a block, the work from all other miners on the network was
                thrown out.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So, the key thought was "instead of reaching consensus on every single block, why don't they just reach
              consensus on which miner will produce blocks for an amount of time?" That idea needed a lot of tweaking,
              of course, but that was the beginning. It enabled an improved incentive, a better distribution structure,
              and allowed for different types of work and value to be rewarded, such as design, marketing, mobile
              development, and so on.

              Our philosophy is that the amount of coins awarded to each individual is determined based on the amount of
              value that was given to the network and/or the community. The exact amount of coins that get minted is
              decided by our Government which is voted in through an open and transparent voting system by the
              community.

              We chose this method of distribution over a more decentralized method, such as mining, because it allows
              for a distribution model that reflects the real world more accurately. Here contributors such as
              designers, marketers, mobile developers, and so on can earn coins through a variety of methods.

              As more people join our Discord from other crypto communities, we emphasize that these other
              cryptocurrencies are not our competition. In fact, we plan to create a tutorial series about many other
              cryptos including Nano, Monero, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              While most other crypto communities out there are busy talking poorly about one another, we are going to
              swim against the current. We are going to bring these communities together by adding as much value as we
              can to them in the form of tutorials, marketing content, blog posts, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why would we possibly spend our limited resources promoting these other communities rather than our own?
              Because the more value we give to their communities, the more value we are going to get right back. Every
              time we create an awesome tutorial series about another crypto, those tutorials will get circulated and
              shared throughout those communities. Want to learn about Ethereum? Check out these videos by thenewboston.

              The goal of this project is not to become the #1 crypto. The goal of this project is to build a better
              economy. It’s a goal that sounds so big it’s almost unimaginable, but that’s exactly what we’re aiming
              for.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s up to us to build what no one else can. We, as thenewboston community, are in a very unique position
              where we can educate, build, and add value to so many other tech communities. We are a community that can
              work together, help each other out, and through that, we truly believe we will accomplish what no other
              development community ever has before.

            worked with. I just told them about the project, shared the initial idea, and they said they were

Banks can freeze your funds with limited justification, overdraft fees, ATM fees, lifelong debt is now the norm, it takes 5-7 business days just to send money in sometimes, and good luck sending money to your family or friends in another country without paying an arm and a leg in fees. We would like to focus as much as possible not so much on our competition whether that be traditional currencies or other cryptocurrencies, but more so on just making our currency the best that we can. Any reason for anyone not to use our currency, it's our job to remove that barrier.",

We hope that, eventually, cryptocurrencies will dominate in general, because everything would be more open and transparent and the economy overall would be more fair. We would imagine, however, that there would be multiple cryptocurrencies given that each one has their own unique benefits. Some are faster than others, some better for privacy, other maybe better for smart contracts, and so on.",
