        Banks play a critical role regarding several aspects of the network. They act as the bond between end users and
        the network, and have several responsibilities to each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding network related responsibilities, banks are responsible for assigning trust levels to validators. This
        will allow the network to not only reach consensus of the primary validator, but also determine the line of
        succession from a list of backup validators in the event the primary validator were to go offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The election of a trusted validator is performed by all banks through the processes of setting a chosen
        validator as their primary validator. The primary validator of their choosing will most often also be the one
        who has earned the highest amount of trust, but is not a strict requirement. Only one primary validator is
        allowed per bank.
      </p>
      <div className="img-container">
        <img alt="validator election" className="validator-election" src={ValidatorElection} />
      </div>
      <p>
        Given the architecture of a peer-to-peer network, all bank nodes are always in constant communication with one
        another. This will allow them to view each other's trust levels of all validators on the network. Through doing
        so, banks will reach consensus on the most trusted validator and that validator will be appointed as the elected
        primary validator for the network. All banks in the network are responsible for assigning their own trust levels
        to each validator. Banks in the network will often set their primary validator as the one that was appointed
        through network consensus, yet assign higher trust levels to other validators as a way of indicating their
        "vote" for the ideal validator. This allows banks to remain part of the network while also recommending an
        alternative validator through open communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banks will also look to earn the trust of other banks in the network to increase their network trust consensus.
        This is done by providing reliable service and accurate information to other bank nodes. They are also
        responsible for monitoring network activity and reporting any mischievous behavior. This will help ensure that
        the same accounts are not joining multiple banks. If there are accounts discovered on the network who are
        registered at multiple banks, it will be announced to the network and remain visible to all nodes until the
        issue is resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the responsibilities to the network, banks also have responsibilities to their users (account
        owners). When users first download account manager applications and create their accounts, they will then select
        a bank in which they wish to register an account with. Upon successful registration with the bank, they are then
        able to connect to the network through that bank and may begin sending transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banks prevent users from the need to set up and maintain their own network servers. Banks will also assign trust
        levels to all of the registered accounts, similar to how trust levels are assigned to validators. The specific
        method of assigning trust levels to the registered accounts is entirely up to the bank itself, but in general
        banks will often assign trust levels based on several factors including:
      </p>
      <ul className="mb-20">
        <li>time since account was first registered (older accounts are generally more trusted)</li>
        <li>previous attempts to register with multiple banks</li>
        <li>previous attempts to pay with insufficient funds</li>
        <li>improper formatting of Txs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lastly, banks will collect transaction fees via transactions sent from users. The transaction fees are
        determined by the individual banks. This will give users the ability to join banks with the most reliable
        service and who offer the lowest transaction fees. Transaction fees are also determined on a per account basis,
        allowing the banks to reward their most trustworthy users. Transaction fees charged to accounts will often be
        tier based, as determined by the users trust level, rather than determining the fees for each individual account
        one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        As briefly mentioned earlier, before users are able to use a bank's services they must first register one (or
        more) of their accounts with that bank. This process involves paying a registration fee to the bank.
        Registration fees are necessary to prove that the account applied at the given bank. Otherwise, any bank would
        be able to lie and state that another bank's user had applied there, therefore harming the reputation and trust
        level of that user account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, the account registration will be placed in a "pending" status as that bank checks with all other
        banks on the network to ensure that the account is not already registered at another bank. As those other banks
        receive this inquiry, they will know not to accept the new account themselves and also report any attempts from
        that account to register. The process of temporarily denying account registrations by other banks is referred to
        as "locking out" the account. Banks will "unlock" the account when an update from the inquiring bank is received
        informing them of the results (that the account was either accepted or rejected). If no update is received,
        banks will have to query the original bank to review both their registration and account lists in order to
        obtain the updated status of that user account.
      </p>
      <div className="img-container">
        <img alt="registration bank members" className="registration-bank-members" src={RegistrationBankMembers} />
      </div>
      <p>
        During this check, if it is discovered that the account is already registered at another bank, the new bank will
        block that account and broadcast their misbehavior to the network. The bank in which they are already registered
        may block them as well, but a more likely scenario is simply a reduced trust level. They will also check that
        the account does not have an untrusted reputation (this does not apply to new accounts). If the account is found
        to be untrusted, the registration status will be set to "rejected" and the account will need to register at a
        different bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are no issues discovered during this check, the registration status will be set to "accepted" and the
        user can begin using their account through that bank. The relationship between the user account and the bank
        will grow over time, along with their trust for each other. Time is one of the largest factors regarding trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        All accounts on the network should only belong to one bank. When the network discovers an account who is
        registered at multiple banks, the network will punish both the offending (new) bank and the user account in the
        form of reduced trust. In addition, if a bank is caught misleading other banks (not revealing their accounts,
        providing false information, etc...) they will be punished by the network in the form of reduced trust.
      </p>

        <img alt="banks and accounts" className="banks-and-accounts" src={BanksAndAccounts} />
      </div>
      <p>
        Important Note: If and when a bank server goes down, the points of all accounts registered with that bank remain
        secure. This is because unlike a real-world bank, network banks do not store points. All account balances are
        maintained and updated by the primary validator and both the root balance sheet and blockchain are continuously
        backed up by several confirmation validators in the case where the primary validator goes down. Banks act simply
        as routers and initial validation mechanisms to enhance the performance of the network by distributing the
        processing power that would otherwise be required by a single node. When a bank server fails, the network will
        become aware of the failed server and acknowledge that those accounts are now free to join a new bank without
        incurring any trust penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        This architecture does not imply that a single human individual should only ever have one account. It is
        perfectly acceptable and even encouraged for individuals to have multiple accounts, only that they do not use
        the same account across multiple banks.
      </p>
      <p>To leave a bank, users can simply make a request to their bank indicating the account number to be removed.</p>
