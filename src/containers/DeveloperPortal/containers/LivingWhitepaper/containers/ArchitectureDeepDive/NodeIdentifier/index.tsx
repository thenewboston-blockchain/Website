          The node identifier (NID) system is a separate key-pair that nodes use for signing requests to other nodes.

          When a node is first deployed, it provides a unique NID to the network. As nodes connect, they keep a record
          of each other's NID as a method of identification. Later on, as nodes exchange requests, a receiving node can
          inspect the digital signature to verify the authenticity of both the sending node and the message itself. This
          system also provides an additional benefit in allowing requests to be sent on behalf of the node maintainer
          without requiring the request to originate from the node itself.

        <h3 className="ArchitectureDeepDive__topic-heading">Sample Request and Response</h3>
        <p className="ArchitectureDeepDive__description">
          An example of where this is useful is during the connection request process. A sample connection request body
          follows:

        <CodeSnippet
          code={`{
  "message": {
    "ip_address": "167.99.173.247",
    "port": "80",
    "protocol": "http"
  },
  "node_identifier": "d5356888dc9303e44ce52b1e06c3165a7759b9df1e6a6dfbd33ee1c3df1ab4d1",
  "signature": "3c88665e123e7e25a8b9d9592f3269ab4efc4bcba98......"
}`}
          language={SnippetLang.json}
        />
        <p className="ArchitectureDeepDive__description">
          Given the structure of the request, clients with access to the NID signing key can start connection requests
          on behalf of their node by sending requests directly from a client app to the target nodes. This also allows
          node owners to manage multiple nodes from the same client apps by importing the NID signing keys of all nodes
          they wish to manage.
        </p>
        <p className="ArchitectureDeepDive__description">
          Although all nodes are already configured with an account number (the public key from a separate key-pair),
          the purpose of the two key-pair systems is quite different. A server's NID must never change after deployment.
          However, users are free to change the account number where they wish to receive their Tx fees at any time.
        </p>
        <p className="ArchitectureDeepDive__description">
          In summary, because all nodes provide a unique NID through their publicly available configurations, all nodes
          can include this identifier in sensitive requests to other nodes to prove that the owner of the nodes has
          authorized each request. A sample response follows:
        </p>
