        you will be prompted to either create a new account or add an existing account. To create a new account, simply
        input a nickname for the account and then click the "Add" button.

        If the application can not automatically connect to the network then you will be prompted to enter the address
        of a bank to connect to. You may also assign a nickname to the given bank. If a nickname is given, the
