        Our governance structure enables voting for all core aspects of the network, both in terms of people and
        validation nodes. Any individual is able to apply to become a governor where other individuals are then able to
        vote for their desired candidates. The nodes that are responsible for the validation of blocks are also chosen
        by individuals through a "boosting" system as described in later sections.
