              This documentation outlines an efficient and scalable peer-to-peer consensus mechanism that allows for
              highly efficient transaction validation within a decentralized network.
              <br /> The key idea behind this architecture is that when building a distributed payment ledger, it is not
              the transaction processing itself that requires distribution across multiple servers. Multiple servers
              processing the same transactions in parallel is an inherent inefficiency in a distributed network because
              work is duplicated. It is rather the ability to elect fairly a single validation server and consensual
              acceptance of the produced results that require distribution among nodes.

            <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
              Regarding the creation of a distributed public ledger, there are several key differences between
              thenewboston network structure and traditional Blockchain architectures.
            </p>
            <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
              An inherent defect in various Blockchain architectures is the inefficient composition of blocks. For
              example, blocks in the Bitcoin Blockchain comprise multiple unrelated transactions. So, within every
              block, the earliest transactions experience significant delays, while later transactions continue to
              accumulate until the entire block gets verified. Focusing on Blockchain performance and nothing else, in
              an ideal architecture, transactions must be validated immediately after they are received, instead of
              waiting for them to bundle along with additional transactions.
            </p>
            <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
              By removing unrelated transactions from blocks, thenewboston can substantially reduce the average network
              block size by constructing blocks that group related transactions only. So, for thenewboston network,
              transfers refer to groups of transactions that must be processed together.
            </p>
            <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
              These improvements, along with others discussed throughout this documentation, reduce the overall energy
              consumption and processing power that the network requires. This increased efficiency enables transactions
              between accounts to be verified within seconds (or less).

            <span className="PrincipalEntities__section-text--highlight">budget</span>, which is a shared account
            managed by the entire government. The budget requires a multisig to access. Our treasury board comprises the
            highest voted members of the government. These members mint new coins into the budget through multisig that
            requires majority agreement. Any treasurer can propose the amount for initial minting. This also counts as a
            "yes" vote. All other treasurers must vote yes or no on whether to mint those coins or not. If the majority
            of treasurers vote yes, the coins are minted into the budget account.

                unique across the entire network and it is an alias that can be purchased with coins. Once an account

            Through the collection of fees individuals receive rewards for maintaining nodes on the network. Users pay
            these fees to their connection node in exchange for the processing of their requests.
          </p>
          <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
            Node owners set their own fee amounts. Users will always consider these amounts when choosing their
            connection nodes, and although they will often consider additional factors (such as server reliability), the
            node fee will be the key consideration for most users of the network.
          </p>
          <p className="PrincipalEntities__section-paragraph">
            Besides the node fee, there is an additional fee paid to the PV. The governors set this fee by majority
            vote, rather than having each validator set their own fee. This prevents nodes from having to determine a
            new PV fee when new validators join the network, or when existing PV responsibilities change. The PV fee is
            set directly on the blockchain, resulting in one unified PV fee across the entire network.
