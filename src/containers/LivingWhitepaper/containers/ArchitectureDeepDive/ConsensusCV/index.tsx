        The decision of whether or not to skip a PV is determined by consensus between the CVs. This process happens
        when a PVâ€™s blocks are scrutinized and directly affects the schedule. When a majority of CVs vote to skip the PV
        during its turn, all CVs must reach consensus on exactly which block the next PV should take over. This is
        because in the middle of each turn, there is no guarantee that all CVs will be perfectly in sync and they might
        have blockchains of varying length. The process for switching to a new PV before the turn finishes follows.
      </p>
      <p className="LivingWhitepaperDocs__description">
        At the beginning of each turn, when a new PV takes over, each CV keeps an independent record of all other CVs'
        voting statuses.

        (performance, error, offline, and so on) this CV sets its status to halt requested and broadcasts that message
        out to all other validators.
