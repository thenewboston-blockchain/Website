        Nodes will inform other nodes when a confirmation block is received from the PV. This is to prevent intentional
        forks by ensuring that the PV is not sending different blocks to different recipients. Once a node receives
        matching confirmation blocks from &gt;50% of eligible nodes, the receiving node will validate the block and upon
        successful validation add the block to itâ€™s blockchain. If an invalid block (miscalculation) or a conflict block
        (fork attempt) is found then the scheduled nodes will reject that block and switch to the next scheduled node as
        PV.
