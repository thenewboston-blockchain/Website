      <DocList variant="ul">
        <li>the Team Lead is aware of how the payment system works</li>
        <li>the project board and labels are properly set up</li>
        <li>all information needed for the team page on the website is completed</li>
        <ul>
          <li>team interview process</li>
          <li>team onboarding guide</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>show them how to add and remove job descriptions</li>
