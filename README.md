## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

To start with, you can always check the [open issues](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Website/issues) in this repository. You can filter these issues using the labels and find the ones that suit your domain.

All issues that have the **PR Reward** label are ready to be worked upon and specify the amount of coins to be transferred to the account of the person who solves that issue.

If you discover a new issue that is not yet reported, please open the same before working on it. People who discover bugs will be rewarded with the amount of coins specified by the **Bug Bounty Owed** labels.

Please avoid working on issues that have the **Not Ready** label on them.

The reward labels will be assigned to issues by the core team members based on certain parameters. If you want to create an issue with a design suggestion, please do it in the [design repository](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Design).

Every PR must be connected to an issue, so as stated above, before creating a PR, please raise an issue and reference it in the PR.

Before starting, add a comment to let others know that you'll be working on that issue.

It is strictly advised to **create a single PR per issue**. In any case, where two or more issues have the same root cause, you can club them in a single PR, otherwise, refrain from doing so.

Also, while working make sure you follow these guidelines:

- [React / JSX Style Guide](https://thenewboston.com/style-guide/react)
- [CSS / SASS Style Guide](https://thenewboston.com/style-guide/css)

Next steps:

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch
3. Run `npm run lint` and make sure you have no errors
4. Commit your changes
5. Push to the branch
6. Open a pull request
