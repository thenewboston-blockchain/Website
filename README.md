## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project. You can request new features by creating an issue, or you can contribute your 
own features by creating a pull request. Before working on a feature it is a good idea to open an issue to ensure the 
feature fits the project.

Bug reports are also appreciated. When reporting a bug try to provide some information that can be used to help 
determine the issue. Things like error messages, package version, and relevant code would be good things to include.

## Getting Started
