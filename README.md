## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any
contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

To start, you can always check the [open issues](https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Website/issues) in this repository. You can filter issues using the labels and find the ones that suit your domain. Mostly, you'll see issues labeled with the coins you'll get if you fix that particular issue. Earning coins improves your rank on the [leaderboard](https://thenewboston.com/leaderboard/All).

Before starting, add a comment to let others know that you'll be working on that issue.

It is strictly advised to **create a single PR per issue**. In any case, where two or more issues have the same root cause, you can club them in a single PR, otherwise, refrain from doing so.

Also, while working make sure you follow these guidelines:

- [React / JSX Style Guide](https://thenewboston.com/style-guide/react)
- [CSS / SASS Style Guide](https://thenewboston.com/style-guide/css)

Next steps:

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch
3. Run `npm run lint` and make sure you have no errors
4. Commit your changes
5. Push to the branch
6. Open a pull request

For further help, you can check out the [FAQs](https://thenewboston.com/faq).

Finally, feel free to shoot any queries or suggestions. Don't hesitate. ;)
